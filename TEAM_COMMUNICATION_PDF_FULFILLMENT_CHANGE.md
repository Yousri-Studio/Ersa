# Team Communication: PDF Course Fulfillment Change

## 📢 Important Change Notice

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Type:** Process Change  
**Impact:** Admin Workflow

## 🎯 What Changed

**PDF course orders now require MANUAL fulfillment by admin.**

### Admins / Order Processors
- **Action Required:** You must now manually fulfill PDF course orders
- **Training:** Follow the new workflow below
- **Time Impact:** +1-2 minutes per order (for quality review)

- **Testing:** Follow testing guide

## 📋 New Admin Workflow

### Before This Change
```
Order Paid → System auto-sends ALL attachments → Done
(Admin had no control)
```

### After This Change
```
Order Paid → Admin reviews order → Admin selects attachments → 
Admin clicks button → Materials delivered → Done
(Admin has full control)
```

## 🖥️ How to Fulfill PDF Course Orders (Step-by-Step)
