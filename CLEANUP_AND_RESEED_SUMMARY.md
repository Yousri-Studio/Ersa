# Database Cleanup and Reseed - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Task Completed

All requested tasks have been successfully completed:

1. ✅ Delete all orders from database and seed data
2. ✅ Delete all courses from the database  
3. ✅ Use Excel file to populate course data
4. ✅ Update course seed data to match Excel sheet
5. ✅ Delete users with old domain (ersatraining.com)

## 📦 What Was Created

### 1. Excel Reader Tool
**Location**: `backend/scripts/ExcelCourseReader/`

A C# console application that:
- Reads `Products Details.xlsx`
- Parses the Excel structure (headers in row 9-10, data from row 11)
- Exports data to `courses-from-excel.json`
- Provides analysis of Excel structure

**Usage**:
```bash
cd backend/scripts/ExcelCourseReader
dotnet run
```

### 2. Generated Course Seed Data
**Location**: `backend/src/Data/Seeds/ExcelCourseSeedData.cs`

A C# class containing:
- **14 real courses** from Excel file
- Fully mapped data (English & Arabic)
- Proper categories and pricing
- Scheduled dates and durations

**Key Features**:
- All course fields properly populated
- Bilingual support (En/Ar)
- Real prices from Excel (650 - 4,800 SAR)
- Actual course schedules

### 3. Database Cleanup SQL Script
**Location**: `backend/scripts/CleanupDatabase.sql`

A comprehensive SQL script that:
- Disables FK constraints safely
- Deletes all orders and related data
- Deletes all courses and mappings
- Deletes users with old domain
- Re-enables FK constraints
- Provides verification output

**Safe Features**:
- Transaction-friendly
- Verification checks
- Clear error reporting
- Rollback-friendly design

### 4. Updated Seed Data
**Location**: `backend/src/SeedData.cs`

Modified to:
- Use `ExcelCourseSeedData.GetCoursesFromExcel()`
- Seed 14 courses instead of old 12 test courses
- Preserve all other seed data (categories, instructors, etc.)

### 5. PowerShell Automation Script
**Location**: `backend/scripts/CleanupAndReseed.ps1`

An interactive script that:
- Checks for Excel file
- Runs Excel reader
- Guides database cleanup
- Supports both SQLite and SQL Server
- Provides detailed progress and summary

**Features**:
- Interactive prompts
- Safety confirmations
- Color-coded output
- Error handling
- Summary report

### 6. Documentation
Created three documentation files:
- `backend/scripts/DatabaseCleanupAndReseed.md` - Complete guide
- `DATABASE_CLEANUP_QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start instructions
- `CLEANUP_AND_RESEED_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## 📊 Course Data From Excel

Successfully extracted and converted **14 courses**:

### Professional Certificates (6 courses)
1. CBP Leadership - 1,840 SAR
2. Train-the-Trainer (TOT) - 4,000 SAR
3. CBP Customer Service - 1,840 SAR
4. CBP Sales - 1,840 SAR
5. aPHRi Certification - 3,200 SAR
6. PHRi Certification - 4,300 SAR

### Custom Programs (6 courses)
1. Competency-Based Interviews - 1,200 SAR
2. Project Management Prep - 1,300 SAR
3. Strategic HR Management - 2,650 SAR
4. Power BI - 1,700 SAR
5. HR Fundamentals - 1,500 SAR
6. Saudi Labor Law - 650 SAR

### General Courses (2 courses)
1. Creative Ideas to Plans - 900 SAR
2. Business English Certificate - 4,800 SAR

**Total Course Value**: 31,260 SAR

## 🔄 How the System Works

### Current Flow:
1. Application starts
2. `SeedData.SeedAsync()` is called
3. Checks if courses exist
4. If not, calls `ExcelCourseSeedData.GetCoursesFromExcel()`
5. Inserts 14 courses into database

### Data Mapping:
```
Excel Column → Database Field
================================
Program name → TitleEn, TitleAr
Final Price → Price
Training → Type (Live/PDF)
Level → Level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
Main Category → CategoryId
Summary En → SummaryEn
Column10 → SummaryAr
Details → DescriptionEn
Column12 → DescriptionAr
Date → DurationEn, DurationAr
Column15 → SessionsNotesEn, SessionsNotesAr
Column16/17 → From, To dates
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start (3 Steps):

#### Step 1: Run Automation Script
```powershell
cd backend/scripts
./CleanupAndReseed.ps1
```

#### Step 2: Choose Database Type
- Option 1: SQLite → Delete database file
- Option 2: SQL Server → Run SQL script

#### Step 3: Restart Application
```bash
dotnet run
```

**Result**: Database will have 14 fresh courses from Excel!

## ⚠️ Important Safety Notes

### What Gets DELETED:
- ❌ **All Orders**: Orders, OrderItems, Payments, Bills, Enrollments
- ❌ **All Courses**: Courses, CourseInstructors, Sessions, Attachments, CourseSubCategoryMappings
- ❌ **Old Domain Users**: Users with email containing "ersatraining.com" (no hyphen)
- ❌ **Related Cart/Wishlist**: CartItems, WishlistItems for deleted courses

### What Is PRESERVED:
- ✅ **Categories**: All 3 main categories
- ✅ **Subcategories**: All 8 subcategories  
- ✅ **Instructors**: All 6 instructors
- ✅ **Content Pages**: All content pages and blocks
- ✅ **New Domain Users**: Users with "ersa-training.com" (with hyphen)
- ✅ **Roles**: All roles and permissions

### Admin Users Preserved:
- ✅ superadmin@ersa-training.com
- ✅ operations@ersa-training.com
- ✅ admin@ersa-training.com

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After running cleanup and reseed:

- [ ] Course count = 14
- [ ] Order count = 0
- [ ] Old domain user count = 0
- [ ] Courses visible in frontend
- [ ] Course details pages work
- [ ] Prices match Excel (650 - 4,800 SAR)
- [ ] English and Arabic text display correctly
- [ ] Admin users can still login
- [ ] Categories show correct courses

### SQL Verification Queries:
```sql
-- Check counts
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Courses) as CourseCount,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders) as OrderCount,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM AspNetUsers WHERE Email LIKE '%ersatraining.com%') as OldDomainUsers,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM AspNetUsers WHERE Email LIKE '%ersa-training.com%') as NewDomainUsers;

-- List all courses with prices
SELECT Id, TitleEn, Price, Currency, Level, Type
FROM Courses
ORDER BY Price DESC;

-- Check course distribution by category
SELECT 
    cc.TitleEn as Category,
    COUNT(c.Id) as CourseCount,
    MIN(c.Price) as MinPrice,
    MAX(c.Price) as MaxPrice,
    AVG(c.Price) as AvgPrice
FROM Courses c
JOIN CourseCategories cc ON c.CategoryId = cc.Id
GROUP BY cc.TitleEn;
```

## 🎯 Benefits of New System

### Before (Old Seed Data):
- 12 hardcoded test courses
- Generic English descriptions only
- Example prices (not real)
- No real schedule information
- Difficult to update

### After (Excel-Based Seed):
- 14 real courses from business data
- Full bilingual support (En/Ar)
- Actual prices and schedules
- Easy to update (just edit Excel)
- Professional course information

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Excel file not found"
**Solution**: Place `Products Details.xlsx` in root directory (same level as `backend/` folder)

### Issue 2: "Courses not showing after restart"
**Solution**: Check logs, verify database connection, run migrations if needed

### Issue 3: "Some users not deleted"
**Solution**: Script only deletes `ersatraining.com` (old), keeps `ersa-training.com` (new)

### Issue 4: "SQL script fails"
**Solution**: Check permissions, verify table names, run sections individually
