# üö® Proxy Returning 500 Error - Diagnostic Guide

## üîç What's Happening

Your proxy calls are returning **500 Internal Server Error**:
```
https://ersa-training.com/api/proxy/?endpoint=/auth/login ‚Üí 500 ‚ùå
https://ersa-training.com/api/proxy/?endpoint=/CourseCategories ‚Üí 500 ‚ùå
```

## üìã Possible Causes (In Order of Likelihood)

### 1. ‚ùå Fixed Code Not Deployed Yet
You changed the code locally but haven't uploaded it to the server yet.

**How to Check:**
- The server is still running the old code with `lapi` typo
- Fixed code is on your local machine only

**Solution:** Deploy the fixed code (instructions below)

---

### 2. ‚ùå Backend API Not Reachable
The proxy can't connect to `http://api.ersa-training.com/api`

**How to Check:**
```bash
# Test from your local machine
curl http://api.ersa-training.com/api/courses

# Or test with browser
# Visit: http://api.ersa-training.com/api/courses
```

**If this fails:**
- Backend is down
- DNS not configured
- Firewall blocking requests

---

### 3. ‚ùå Environment Variable Not Set
`BACKEND_API_URL` is not set on the production server

**How to Check:**
- Look at Next.js server logs
- Should see which URL the proxy is trying to reach

**Solution:** Set environment variable or rely on fallback URL

---

## üîß Quick Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Check Backend API
```bash
# Can you reach the backend directly?
curl http://api.ersa-training.com/api/courses

# Expected: JSON response with courses
# If fails: Backend is the problem, not the proxy
```

### Step 2: Check Next.js Server Logs
Login to your hosting and check the logs. Look for:
```
[API Proxy POST] /auth/login
[API Proxy] Forwarding to: http://???/api/auth/login
[API Proxy] Error: ...
```

This will tell you:
- What URL it's trying to reach
- What error is occurring

### Step 3: Check Deployed Files
Verify these files on your server:
- `app/api/proxy/route.ts` - Has the fix?
- `.env.production` - Has `BACKEND_API_URL`?
- `.next/` folder - Rebuilt after fix?

---

## üöÄ Fix It Now

### Option A: Quick Test (Check Backend First)

Before deploying anything, verify the backend is accessible:

```bash
# From your local machine
curl -v http://api.ersa-training.com/api/courses

# Should return JSON, not error
```

**If backend is NOT accessible:**
1. Check if backend server is running
2. Check DNS: Does `api.ersa-training.com` resolve?
3. Check firewall/security rules
4. Fix backend first, then come back to frontend

---

### Option B: Deploy Fixed Frontend

If backend is accessible, deploy the fix:

#### 1. **Verify Local Fix**
Check that `frontend/app/api/proxy/route.ts` has:
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.BACKEND_API_URL || 'http://api.ersa-training.com/api';
```

**NOT**:
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.BACKEND_API_URL || 'http://lapi.ersa-training.com/api';
```

#### 2. **Create Environment File**

Create `frontend/.env.production`:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=/api/proxy?endpoint=
BACKEND_API_URL=http://api.ersa-training.com/api
PORT=3000
```

#### 3. **Rebuild**
```bash
cd D:\Data\work\Ersa\frontend
npm run build
```

Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes)

#### 4. **Deploy**

Upload to server:
- `app/api/proxy/route.ts` (fixed file)
- `.next/` folder (rebuilt)
- `.env.production` (new file)

#### 5. **Restart Node.js**

In SmarterASP.NET control panel:
- Go to Node.js Manager
- Click Restart
- Wait 1 minute

#### 6. **Test Again**
```bash
curl "https://ersa-training.com/api/proxy?endpoint=/courses"
```

## üîç Advanced Troubleshooting

### Check Server Environment

SSH or access your server console and check:

```bash
# Check if environment variable is set
echo $BACKEND_API_URL

# Check if .env.production exists
ls -la .env.production
cat .env.production
```

### Check Next.js Process

```bash
# Check if Next.js is running
ps aux | grep node

# Check Node.js error logs
# Location depends on your hosting setup
```

### Test Proxy Directly

```bash
# Test proxy with a simple endpoint
curl -v "https://ersa-training.com/api/proxy?endpoint=/courses"

# Look for:
# - 500 error
# - Error message in response
# - Connection errors
```

---

## üìä Error Analysis

### 500 Error Means:

| Scenario | Proxy Logs Would Show |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Backend unreachable** | "fetch failed", "ECONNREFUSED" |
| **DNS failure** | "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND" |
| **Timeout** | "request timeout" |
| **Wrong URL** | "fetch failed" to wrong domain |
| **Code error** | Stack trace |

Without seeing the actual logs, we can't know which one it is.

## üéØ Most Likely Scenario

Based on your symptoms, here's what's probably happening:

```
1. You fixed the typo locally ‚úÖ
   ‚Üì
2. But haven't deployed to server yet ‚ùå
   ‚Üì
3. Server still has old code with "lapi" typo ‚ùå
   ‚Üì
4. Proxy tries to reach: http://lapi.ersa-training.com/api
   ‚Üì
5. DNS can't resolve "lapi.ersa-training.com"
   ‚Üì
6. Proxy crashes with 500 error
```

**Solution:** Deploy the fixed code!

---

## üö® Emergency Quick Fix

If you need to test RIGHT NOW without full deployment:

### 1. Check if backend works directly:
```bash
curl http://api.ersa-training.com/api/courses
```

### 2. If it works, temporarily bypass proxy:

In your browser console (F12), run:
```javascript
// Test backend directly
fetch('http://api.ersa-training.com/api/courses')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error)
```

**Note:** This will likely fail due to CORS, but will confirm if backend is reachable.

## üìù Checklist

Before you deploy, verify:

- [ ] Backend API is running and accessible
- [ ] `curl http://api.ersa-training.com/api/courses` works
- [ ] Fixed proxy file locally (no "lapi" typo)
- [ ] Created `.env.production` file
- [ ] Rebuilt frontend (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Ready to upload fixed files

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Uploaded `.next` folder
- [ ] Uploaded `app/api/proxy/route.ts`
- [ ] Uploaded `.env.production`
- [ ] Restarted Node.js
- [ ] Checked server logs for errors
- [ ] Tested: `curl "https://ersa-training.com/api/proxy?endpoint=/courses"`

## üÜò Still Getting 500?

If you've deployed and still getting 500:

1. **Check Server Logs** - This is CRITICAL
   - Find where Next.js logs are stored
   - Look for error messages
   - Share them for further diagnosis

2. **Check Backend Connectivity FROM Server**
   - SSH into your hosting server
   - Run: `curl http://api.ersa-training.com/api/courses`
   - If this fails, it's a network/firewall issue

3. **Verify Files Deployed**
   - Check file timestamps
   - Make sure new files were actually uploaded
   - Clear any CDN cache

4. **Test Simpler Endpoint**
   ```bash
   # Try a GET endpoint first
   curl "https://ersa-training.com/api/proxy?endpoint=/courses"
   ```

---

## üìû What We Need to Know

To help you further, we need:

1. **Server Logs** - What does Next.js log say?
2. **Backend Status** - Does `http://api.ersa-training.com/api/courses` work?
3. **File Timestamps** - When were files last updated on server?
4. **Deployment Status** - Did you deploy the fixed code yet?

---

**Most Important:** Check the server logs first! The 500 error means the proxy is crashing, and the logs will tell us exactly why.
