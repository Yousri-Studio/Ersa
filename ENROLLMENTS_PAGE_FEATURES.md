## User Flow
1. User navigates to `/profile/enrollments`
2. System checks authentication
3. If not authenticated ‚Üí Redirect to login
4. If authenticated ‚Üí Fetch enrollments
5. Display courses in grid layout
6. User can:
   - Search by course name
   - Filter by category
   - Filter by status
   - Sort by date/name/progress
   - Click "Start Course" to begin learning
   - Click "View All Orders" to see order history

## Filter Logic
The filtering system works as follows:
1. **Search** is applied first (case-insensitive, searches course title)
2. **Category filter** is applied to search results
3. **Status filter** is applied to category-filtered results
4. **Sorting** is applied last to the final filtered set

## Performance Considerations
- Filters are applied client-side for instant feedback
- Animations use stagger for better perceived performance
- Lazy loading for course images
- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks
