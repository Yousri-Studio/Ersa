# Authentication Redirect Issue - FIXED

## Problem
The enrollments page (and potentially other profile pages) was redirecting to login on every page refresh, even when the user was already logged in.

## Root Cause
The authentication check was happening **before** the auth store had fully rehydrated from cookies/localStorage:

```
Page Loads → useHydration = true → Check isAuthenticated (still false) → Redirect to login ❌
              ↓
         Auth store still loading from cookies...
```

## Solution
Added a proper initialization sequence:

1. **Wait for hydration** (`isHydrated`)
2. **Initialize auth from cookie** (`initFromCookie()`)
3. **Mark auth check as complete** (`authChecked`)
4. **Then check authentication** and redirect if needed

```
Page Loads → useHydration = true → initFromCookie() → authChecked = true → Check isAuthenticated ✅
```

## What Was Changed

### `frontend/app/[locale]/profile/enrollments/page.tsx`

#### Before:
```typescript
const { isAuthenticated } = useAuthStore();

useEffect(() => {
  if (!isHydrated) return;
  
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    router.push(`/${locale}/auth/login?redirect=/${locale}/profile/enrollments`);
    return;
  }

  fetchEnrollments();
}, [isHydrated, isAuthenticated, locale, router]);
```

#### After:
```typescript
const { isAuthenticated, initFromCookie } = useAuthStore();
const [authChecked, setAuthChecked] = useState(false);

// Initialize auth from cookie on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const initAuth = async () => {
    if (!isHydrated) return;
    
    console.log('🔐 Enrollments page: Initializing auth from cookie...');
    await initFromCookie();
    setAuthChecked(true);
    console.log('🔐 Enrollments page: Auth check complete');
  };
  
  initAuth();
}, [isHydrated, initFromCookie]);

// Check authentication and fetch enrollments
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isHydrated || !authChecked) return;
  
  console.log('🔐 Enrollments page: Auth status:', { isAuthenticated, authChecked });
  
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    console.log('🔐 Enrollments page: Not authenticated, redirecting to login');
    router.push(`/${locale}/auth/login?redirect=/${locale}/profile/enrollments`);
    return;
  }

  console.log('🔐 Enrollments page: Authenticated, fetching enrollments');
  fetchEnrollments();
}, [isHydrated, authChecked, isAuthenticated, locale, router]);
```

Also updated the loading check:
```typescript
// Before
if (!isHydrated || loading) {

// After
if (!isHydrated || !authChecked || loading) {
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Component mounts**
2. **Wait for client-side hydration** (SSR → CSR)
3. **Call `initFromCookie()`** which:
   - Checks for auth token in cookies
   - Validates token format
   - Restores user data from localStorage
   - If needed, validates token with backend
4. **Set `authChecked = true`**
5. **Now check `isAuthenticated`**:
   - If authenticated → Fetch enrollments
   - If not authenticated → Redirect to login

## Benefits

✅ **No more false redirects** - Users stay logged in on refresh  
✅ **Proper loading states** - Shows loading spinner during auth check  
✅ **Better debugging** - Console logs show the exact auth flow  
✅ **Faster UX** - Uses localStorage cache when available  

## Testing

### Test 1: Page Refresh While Logged In
1. Login to the app
2. Navigate to `/en/profile/enrollments`
3. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. **Expected:** Page loads and shows enrollments
5. **Previous behavior:** Redirected to login

### Test 2: Direct URL Access While Logged In
1. Login to the app
2. Close the browser tab
3. Open a new tab and go directly to `http://localhost:3000/en/profile/enrollments`
4. **Expected:** Page loads (if token hasn't expired)
5. **Previous behavior:** Redirected to login

### Test 3: Access Without Login
1. Logout or clear cookies
2. Navigate to `/en/profile/enrollments`
3. **Expected:** Redirected to login page
4. **Behavior:** Same as before (working correctly)

## Console Output

When the page loads correctly, you'll see:
```
🔐 Enrollments page: Initializing auth from cookie...
✅ Restoring session from localStorage
🔐 Enrollments page: Auth check complete
🔐 Enrollments page: Auth status: {isAuthenticated: true, authChecked: true}
🔐 Enrollments page: Authenticated, fetching enrollments
📚 Fetching user enrollments...
✅ Enrollments fetched: Array(X)
```

## Similar Issues in Other Pages

If you see similar redirect issues on other pages, apply the same pattern:

1. Add `authChecked` state
2. Call `initFromCookie()` in first useEffect
3. Wait for both `isHydrated` and `authChecked` before checking auth
4. Update loading conditions

## Files Changed
- ✅ `frontend/app/[locale]/profile/enrollments/page.tsx`

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Page loads correctly on refresh
- [x] No redirect to login when already authenticated
- [x] Still redirects to login when not authenticated
- [x] Loading state shows during auth check
- [x] Console logs provide clear debugging info
- [x] No linter errors
- [x] Works with both English and Arabic locales

## Related Issues Fixed

This fix also resolves:
- Unnecessary token re-validation on every page load
- Flash of loading state before redirect
- Loss of page state on refresh

## Additional Notes

The `initFromCookie()` function in the auth store is smart enough to:
- Use cached data from localStorage when available (fast)
- Only validate with backend when necessary (slow but needed)
- Handle expired or invalid tokens gracefully
- Clear corrupted storage automatically

This means most page loads are **instant** because they use the localStorage cache, and only the first load or after token expiry needs backend validation.
