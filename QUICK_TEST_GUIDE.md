# Quick Test Guide - Authentication & Enrollments Fix

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Missing Icons (Frontend)
- Fixed `academic-cap` icon ‚Üí Changed to `graduation-cap`
- Added `refresh` and `receipt` icons

### 2. ‚úÖ Authentication Redirect Loop (Frontend)
- **Problem:** Enrollments page redirected to login on every refresh
- **Fixed:** Properly initialize auth from cookies before checking authentication

### 3. ‚úÖ Missing Enrollments (Backend)
- **Problem:** Users with paid orders had no enrollments
- **Fixed:** Created admin tools to diagnose and fix missing enrollments

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Login & Enrollments Page (5 min)

1. **Start the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the fix:**
   - Login to the app at `http://localhost:3000/en/auth/login`
   - Navigate to "My Enrollments" or go to `http://localhost:3000/en/profile/enrollments`
   - **‚úì Page should load successfully**
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - **‚úì Should NOT redirect to login**
   - **‚úì Should show your enrollments** (if any exist)

4. **Check console logs:**
   You should see:
   ```
   üîê Enrollments page: Initializing auth from cookie...
   ‚úÖ Restoring session from localStorage
   üîê Enrollments page: Auth check complete
   üîê Enrollments page: Auth status: {isAuthenticated: true, authChecked: true}
   üîê Enrollments page: Authenticated, fetching enrollments
   üìö Fetching user enrollments...
   ```

### Test 2: Fix Missing Enrollments (10 min)

**IMPORTANT:** Only run this if users have paid orders but no enrollments!

1. **Login as admin** (in the browser)

2. **Get your admin token:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to: Application/Storage ‚Üí Cookies
   - Copy the value of `auth-token`

3. **Run the diagnostic script:**
   ```powershell
   cd D:\Data\work\Ersa
   .\fix-enrollments.ps1
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Paste your admin token
   - Review the diagnostics
   - Type 'Y' to fix missing enrollments

5. **Verify:**
   - Check the results in the script output
   - Have the user refresh their enrollments page
   - They should now see all their courses!

### Test 3: Direct URL Access (2 min)

1. **While logged in:**
   - Close the browser tab (don't logout)
   - Open a new browser window
   - Go directly to: `http://localhost:3000/en/profile/enrollments`
   - **‚úì Should load without redirect** (if token hasn't expired)

### Test 4: Logout Behavior (1 min)

1. **Logout from the app**
2. **Try to access:** `http://localhost:3000/en/profile/enrollments`
3. **‚úì Should redirect to login** (this is correct behavior)

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators

- **No redirect loop** when refreshing enrollments page
- **No console errors** about missing icons
- **Enrollments display** if user has purchased courses
- **Smooth login experience** without unexpected logouts
- **Console logs** show proper auth flow

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators

If you see these, something went wrong:

- **Redirects to login** on every refresh (even when logged in)
- **Console error:** "Icon not found: name='academic-cap'"
- **Empty enrollments** when user has paid orders
- **401 Unauthorized** errors in console
- **No console logs** from auth initialization

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still redirects to login on refresh

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Logout and login again
3. Check that `auth-token` cookie exists
4. Check console for auth initialization logs

### Problem: No enrollments showing

**Solution:**
1. Check if orders have status = `Paid` in database
2. Run the diagnostic endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:5002/api/admin/enrollment-diagnostics" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
   ```
3. Run the fix endpoint or use the PowerShell script
4. Refresh the enrollments page

### Problem: Icons still missing

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check that frontend is running the latest build
4. Check console for the exact icon name in error

### Problem: "auth-token cookie not found"

**Solution:**
1. Login again
2. Check cookie domain matches your URL
3. Check browser privacy settings allow cookies
4. Try incognito/private window

## Quick Rollback

If something breaks, you can rollback the enrollments page:

```bash
cd frontend
git checkout HEAD~1 app/[locale]/profile/enrollments/page.tsx
npm run dev
```

Then report the issue with console logs attached.

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Test login flow on staging
- [ ] Test enrollment page refresh on staging
- [ ] Run enrollment diagnostics on production database
- [ ] Fix any missing enrollments before users notice
- [ ] Monitor error logs for auth issues
- [ ] Test with both English and Arabic locales
- [ ] Verify cookie persistence across page refreshes
- [ ] Check that logout still works properly

## Support

If issues persist:

1. **Gather debug info:**
   - Browser console logs (full output)
   - Network tab (API calls)
   - Backend logs
   - User's browser and OS

2. **Check these files:**
   - `AUTH_REDIRECT_FIX.md` - Auth flow explanation
   - `ENROLLMENT_DIAGNOSTICS_FIX.md` - Enrollment issues

3. **Database queries to run:**
   ```sql
   -- Check user's orders
   SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE UserId = 'user-guid-here';
   
   -- Check user's enrollments
   SELECT * FROM Enrollments WHERE UserId = 'user-guid-here';
   
   -- Find paid orders without enrollments
   SELECT o.* FROM Orders o
   LEFT JOIN Enrollments e ON e.OrderId = o.Id
   WHERE o.Status = 2 AND e.Id IS NULL;
   ```

## Success Metrics

After deployment, these should improve:

- ‚úÖ Reduced login page redirects
- ‚úÖ Fewer support tickets about "lost courses"
- ‚úÖ Better user retention on enrollments page
- ‚úÖ Faster page loads (using localStorage cache)
- ‚úÖ Cleaner console logs (no icon warnings)
