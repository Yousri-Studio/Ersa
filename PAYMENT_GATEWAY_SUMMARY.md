## 🔧 Configuration

### appsettings.json Structure

```json
{
  "PaymentGateway": {
    "GatewayMethod": 0,
    "DefaultGateway": "HyperPay"
  },
  "HyperPay": {
    "ApiUrl": "https://test.oppwa.com",
    "CheckoutUrl": "https://test.oppwa.com/v1/paymentWidgets.js?checkoutId",
    "EntityId": "your-entity-id",
    "AccessToken": "your-access-token",
    "WebhookSecret": "your-webhook-secret"
  },
  "ClickPay": {
    "ApiUrl": "https://secure.clickpay.com.sa",
    "ProfileId": "your-profile-id",
    "ServerKey": "your-server-key",
    "WebhookSecret": "your-webhook-secret",
    "MerchantCountryCode": "SA",
    "Currency": "SAR"
  }
}
```

---

## 🔌 New API Endpoints

### GET /api/payments/config
Returns payment gateway configuration

**Response:**
```json
{
  "gatewayMethod": 0,
  "availableGateways": ["HyperPay", "ClickPay"],
  "defaultGateway": "HyperPay",
  "showSelector": true
}
```

### POST /api/payments/hyperpay/webhook
Dedicated HyperPay webhook endpoint

### POST /api/payments/clickpay/webhook
Dedicated ClickPay webhook endpoint

### POST /api/payments/checkout (Updated)
Now accepts optional `paymentProvider` field

---

## 🎨 Frontend Integration Example

```typescript
// 1. Fetch configuration
const config = await paymentsApi.getConfig();

// 2. Show selector if multiple gateways
if (config.data.showSelector) {
  // Display radio buttons for gateway selection
  config.data.availableGateways.map(gateway => ...)
}

// 3. Create checkout with selected gateway
await paymentsApi.createCheckout({
  orderId: order.id,
  returnUrl: window.location.origin + '/checkout/return',
  paymentProvider: selectedGateway
});
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend

```bash
cd backend/src
dotnet build
dotnet publish -c Release
# Deploy to your server
```

### 2. Update Configuration

- Set `GatewayMethod` to desired value (0, 1, or 2)
- Add ClickPay credentials (ProfileId, ServerKey, etc.)
- Update webhook secrets

### 3. Configure Webhooks

Set these URLs in gateway merchant dashboards:
- HyperPay: `https://api.ersa-training.com/api/payments/hyperpay/webhook`
- ClickPay: `https://api.ersa-training.com/api/payments/clickpay/webhook`

### 4. Deploy Frontend

Update frontend to fetch payment config and show gateway selector

### 5. Test

- Test configuration endpoint
- Test checkout with both gateways
- Test webhooks
- Test refunds

---

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ **Webhook Signature Validation**
- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification for both gateways

✅ **Authorization**
- Checkout requires authentication
- User can only checkout their own orders

✅ **Gateway Validation**
- Backend validates gateway is enabled before processing

✅ **Provider Isolation**
- Separate webhook endpoints prevent cross-gateway attacks

---

## 📊 Benefits

### For Business
- **Flexibility:** Switch between gateways or offer both
- **Redundancy:** If one gateway has issues, use the other
- **Competition:** Can negotiate better rates with multiple providers
- **Regional Support:** ClickPay optimized for Saudi Arabia

### For Development
- **Clean Architecture:** Easy to add more gateways
- **Maintainability:** Each gateway isolated in its own class
- **Testability:** Easy to mock and test individual gateways
- **Extensibility:** Clear pattern for adding new payment providers

### For Users
- **Choice:** Can select preferred payment method
- **Reliability:** Multiple payment options increase success rate
- **Localization:** ClickPay UI in Arabic for Saudi users

FROM Payments
WHERE CreatedAt > DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE())
GROUP BY Provider
```

### Average Processing Time
```sql
SELECT 
  Provider,
  AVG(DATEDIFF(SECOND, CreatedAt, CapturedAt)) as AvgSeconds
FROM Payments
WHERE Status = 3 AND CapturedAt IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Provider
```

### Gateway Usage Distribution
```sql
SELECT 
  Provider,
  COUNT(*) as TotalPayments,
  SUM(Amount) as TotalRevenue
FROM Payments p
JOIN Orders o ON p.OrderId = o.Id
WHERE p.CreatedAt > DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE())
GROUP BY Provider
```
