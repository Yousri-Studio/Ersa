# SendGrid "Unauthorized" Error - Issue Summary

## Problem
Production emails are failing with this error:
```
Failed to send verification email to ******@*****.com
Status: "Unauthorized"
Error: {"errors":[{"message":"The provided authorization grant is invalid, expired, or revoked",...}]}
```

## Root Cause
The SendGrid API key configured in production is **invalid, expired, or revoked**.

## Investigation Results

### ✅ What I Found

1. **SendGrid is properly configured** in the code:
   - ✅ `EmailService.cs` correctly implements SendGrid
   - ✅ `Program.cs` properly registers SendGrid client
   - ✅ Configuration reads from `appsettings.json`

2. **API key was hardcoded** (security issue):
   - ❌ Old exposed key: `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`
   - ✅ **Already removed** from `appsettings.json` (committed in this session)
   - ✅ Now shows empty string: `"ApiKey": ""`

3. **Production uses different configuration**:
   - Production may have environment variables set
   - Or production has a different `appsettings.json` deployed
   - Need to check Site4Now.net control panel

## What Was Fixed

### Security Fix Applied
- ✅ Removed hardcoded SendGrid API key from `appsettings.json`
- ✅ Updated to use empty string (forces environment variable usage)
- ✅ Prevented key exposure in git repository

### Files Modified
- ✅ `backend/src/appsettings.json` - Removed hardcoded API key
- ✅ Created documentation: `SENDGRID_UNAUTHORIZED_FIX.md`
- ✅ Created production guide: `SENDGRID_SITE4NOW_PRODUCTION_FIX.md`

## ⚠️ What You Need to Do

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Create New SendGrid API Key**
   - Go to [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com/)
   - Settings → API Keys → Create API Key
   - Copy the new key (starts with `SG.`)

2. **Revoke Old Exposed Key**
   - In SendGrid dashboard, delete/revoke the old key
   - This prevents misuse of the exposed key

3. **Update Production Configuration**
   
   **Option A: Via Site4Now.net Control Panel**
   - Log into Site4Now.net
   - Find your backend's `appsettings.json`
   - Update `SendGrid:ApiKey` with new key
   - Restart application

   **Option B: Via Environment Variables** (if available)
   - Set environment variable: `SendGrid__ApiKey`
   - Value: Your new API key
   - Restart application

4. **Verify Sender Email in SendGrid**
   - Settings → Sender Authentication
   - Verify: `noreply@ersa-training.com`
   - This is **required** for SendGrid to send emails

5. **Test Email Sending**
   - Try user registration
   - Check if verification email arrives
   - Monitor logs for success

## Configuration Flow

```
ASP.NET Core Configuration Priority (highest to lowest):
1. Environment Variables (e.g., SendGrid__ApiKey)
2. appsettings.{Environment}.json
3. appsettings.json
```

**Current State:**
- `appsettings.json` → `"ApiKey": ""` (empty)
- `appsettings.Development.json` → Has test key for local development
- **Production** → Needs new key (via environment variable or file)

## Why "Unauthorized" Error Occurs

SendGrid returns "Unauthorized" when:
1. ❌ API key is invalid/malformed
2. ❌ API key is expired
3. ❌ API key is revoked
4. ❌ API key permissions don't include "Mail Send"
5. ❌ Sender email is not verified in SendGrid

## Verification Steps

### After Updating API Key

1. **Check SendGrid Activity**
   - [Activity Feed](https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity)
   - Look for sent emails
   - Check delivery status

2. **Check Application Logs**
   - Look for: `"Verification email sent successfully"`
   - No more: `"Unauthorized"` errors

3. **Test Registration**
   - Register new user
   - Should receive verification email
   - Code should be valid

## Environment Comparison

| Environment | API Key Location | Current Status |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Development** | `appsettings.Development.json` | ✅ Has test key |
| **Production** | Site4Now.net config | ❌ Needs new key |
| **Repository** | `appsettings.json` | ✅ Secured (empty) |

### Configuration Format
```json
{
  "SendGrid": {
    "ApiKey": "SG.your-actual-key-here",
    "FromEmail": "noreply@ersa-training.com",

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Commit the security fix** (remove hardcoded key)
   ```bash
   git add backend/src/appsettings.json
   git commit -m "Security: Remove exposed SendGrid API key"
   git push
   ```

2. ⏳ **Create new SendGrid API key**
   - See: SENDGRID_SITE4NOW_PRODUCTION_FIX.md

3. ⏳ **Update production configuration**
   - See: SENDGRID_SITE4NOW_PRODUCTION_FIX.md

4. ⏳ **Verify sender email**
   - See: SENDGRID_SITE4NOW_PRODUCTION_FIX.md

5. ⏳ **Test and verify**
   - See: SENDGRID_SITE4NOW_PRODUCTION_FIX.md

## Summary

**Issue**: Production SendGrid API key is invalid/expired  
**Fix**: Create new key + update production config + verify sender  
**Security**: Removed hardcoded key from repository  
**Documentation**: Complete guides created  
**Status**: Waiting for you to create new key and update production
