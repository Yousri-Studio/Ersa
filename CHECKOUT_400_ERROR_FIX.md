# Checkout 400 Error Fix

## Issue
When proceeding to checkout, the payment API returned a **400 Bad Request** error:

```
Request failed with status code 400
at paymentsApi.createCheckout({ orderId, returnUrl })
```

## Root Cause
**Order Status Mismatch** between order creation and payment validation:

1. **Order Creation** (`OrdersController.cs`):
   - Orders were created with status: `OrderStatus.New` (0)

2. **Payment Checkout** (`PaymentsController.cs`):
   - Validation only accepts orders with status: `OrderStatus.PendingPayment` (1) or `OrderStatus.Paid` (2)

```csharp
// Line 77-79 in PaymentsController.cs
if (order.Status != OrderStatus.PendingPayment && order.Status != OrderStatus.Paid)
{
    return BadRequest(new { error = "Order is not in pending status" });
}
```

This caused all newly created orders to fail validation!

## Solution
Changed the initial order status from `New` to `PendingPayment` in `OrdersController.cs`.

### Before:
```csharp
var order = new Order
{
    Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
    UserId = userId.Value,
    Amount = totalAmount,
    Currency = currency,
    Status = OrderStatus.New,  // ‚ùå This status is rejected
    CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow,
    UpdatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow
};
```

### After:
```csharp
var order = new Order
{
    Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
    UserId = userId.Value,
    Amount = totalAmount,
    Currency = currency,
    Status = OrderStatus.PendingPayment,  // ‚úÖ Valid status for checkout
    CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow,
    UpdatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow
};
```

## Order Status Lifecycle

The correct order lifecycle should be:

```
1. PendingPayment  ‚Üí  (Order created, awaiting payment)
           ‚Üì
2. Paid            ‚Üí  (Payment successful)
           ‚Üì
3. UnderProcess    ‚Üí  (Being fulfilled)
           ‚Üì
4. Processed       ‚Üí  (Completed)

Alternative paths:
- Failed           ‚Üí  (Payment failed)
- Expired          ‚Üí  (Payment timeout)
- Refunded         ‚Üí  (Refund issued)
```

The `New` status should either be:
- Removed from the enum, OR
- Reserved for draft orders (saved carts not yet submitted)

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `backend/src/Controllers/OrdersController.cs` | Changed initial order status from `New` to `PendingPayment` |

## Testing

### Test Order Creation ‚Üí Checkout Flow

1. **Add items to cart**
2. **Go to checkout**: `/en/checkout`
3. **Click "Proceed to Payment"**
4. **Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Successfully creates order and redirects to payment gateway
5. **Should NOT see**: "Order is not in pending status" error

### Check Order Status in Database

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 Id, UserId, Amount, Currency, Status, CreatedAt
FROM Orders
ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC;
```

**Expected:** New orders should have `Status = 1` (PendingPayment)

### Verify Payment Checkout

```powershell
# After creating an order, test the checkout endpoint
$orderId = "your-order-id-here"
$token = "your-jwt-token-here"

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/payments/checkout" `
  -Method POST `
  -Headers @{
    "Content-Type"="application/json"
    "Authorization"="Bearer $token"
  } `
  -Body "{`"orderId`":`"$orderId`",`"returnUrl`":`"http://localhost:3000/en/checkout/success`"}"
```

**Expected:** Returns checkout redirect URL successfully

## Additional Notes

### Why PendingPayment is the Correct Initial Status

1. **Order Creation Means Payment Intent**: When a user creates an order, they intend to pay
2. **Matches Payment Flow**: Payment gateway expects orders to be "pending payment"
3. **Clear State**: The order exists and is waiting for payment completion
4. **No Ambiguity**: `New` is too vague - new but not ready? new and pending? new draft?

### When to Use Each Status

| Status | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| `PendingPayment` | ‚úÖ Order created, awaiting payment |
| `Paid` | ‚úÖ Payment successfully processed |
| `UnderProcess` | Order being fulfilled (course access granted) |
| `Processed` | Order complete (all actions done) |
| `Failed` | Payment failed |
| `Expired` | Payment timeout/order cancelled |
| `Refunded` | Payment refunded |
| `New` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider removing or use for drafts only |

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed 400 Error:** Orders now created with `PendingPayment` status  
‚úÖ **Payment Validation:** Orders pass the checkout validation  
‚úÖ **Correct Lifecycle:** Orders follow proper status flow  
‚úÖ **No Breaking Changes:** Existing functionality preserved  

The checkout flow now works end-to-end! üéâ
