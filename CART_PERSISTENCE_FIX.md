# 🛒 Cart Persistence Issue - Fixed!

## 🔍 The Problem

Cart items were disappearing after page refresh, even though the cart store was using Zustand's `persist` middleware.

## ❌ Root Causes

1. **Incorrect storage configuration**: The `persist` middleware was using `customStorage` directly instead of wrapping it with `createJSONStorage()`
2. **Missing partialize**: The store wasn't explicitly defining which state should be persisted
3. **No explicit hydration**: The persist middleware wasn't properly configured for Next.js SSR environment

## ✅ The Fixes

### 1. Updated Zustand Persist Configuration

**Before:**
```typescript
export const useCartStore = create<CartState>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({ /* ... */ }),
    {
      name: 'cart-storage',
      storage: customStorage as any, // ❌ Direct storage usage
    }
  )
);
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { persist, createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware';

export const useCartStore = create<CartState>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({ /* ... */ }),
    {
      name: 'cart-storage',
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => customStorage), // ✅ Proper storage wrapper
      partialize: (state) => ({
        cartId: state.cartId,
        anonymousId: state.anonymousId,
        items: state.items,
        total: state.total,
        currency: state.currency,
      }), // ✅ Explicitly define what to persist
    }
  )
);
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging

Added comprehensive logging to help diagnose cart persistence issues:

**In `cart-store.ts` (addItem function):**
- Logs when item is added
- Logs current cart state before update
- Logs new state after update
- Logs backend sync status

**In `cart/page.tsx`:**
- Logs hydration status
- Logs cart items
- Logs raw localStorage content

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Add Item and Refresh
1. Navigate to any course page (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/en/courses/1`)
2. Click "Add to Cart" button
3. Open browser DevTools Console (F12)
4. Look for logs starting with 🛒
5. You should see:
   ```
   🛒 addItem called with: {...}
   🛒 Setting new state - items: [...]
   🛒 State after set - items: [...]
   ```
6. Navigate to cart page (`http://localhost:3000/en/cart`)
7. Verify the item is displayed
8. **Refresh the page (F5)**
9. Check console for:
   ```
   🛒 Cart Page - isHydrated: true
   🛒 Cart Page - items: [...]
   🛒 Cart Page - localStorage: {"state":{...}}
   ```
10. ✅ **Item should still be visible after refresh!**

### Test 2: Verify localStorage
1. Open DevTools → Application tab (Chrome) or Storage tab (Firefox)
2. Navigate to Local Storage → `http://localhost:3000`
3. Look for key: `cart-storage`
4. You should see a JSON object with:
   ```json
   {
     "state": {
       "cartId": "...",
       "items": [...],
       "total": 1200,
       "currency": "SAR"
     }
   }
   ```

### Test 3: Add Multiple Items
1. Add 2-3 different courses to cart
2. Refresh page after each addition
3. All items should persist

### Test 4: Clear Browser Cache
1. Add items to cart
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen browser and navigate to cart page
4. Items should still be there (localStorage survives browser restart)

## 📝 What Changed

### Files Modified:
1. **`frontend/lib/cart-store.ts`**
   - Added `createJSONStorage` import
   - Updated `persist` configuration with proper storage wrapper
   - Added `partialize` to explicitly define persisted state
   - Added debug logging to `addItem` function

2. **`frontend/app/[locale]/cart/page.tsx`**
   - Added debug console logging for hydration and cart state

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Why `createJSONStorage` is needed:

Zustand v4+ requires storage adapters to be wrapped with `createJSONStorage()` for proper serialization/deserialization. This ensures:
- ✅ State is correctly stringified before saving to localStorage
- ✅ State is correctly parsed when loading from localStorage
- ✅ SSR safety (no localStorage access during server render)
- ✅ Proper error handling for corrupt data

### Why `partialize` is important:

The `partialize` option explicitly defines which parts of the state should be persisted. This:
- ✅ Prevents persisting computed values or functions
- ✅ Reduces localStorage size
- ✅ Makes hydration more predictable
- ✅ Avoids serialization errors

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Cart items persist across:**
- Page refreshes (F5)
- Navigation (back/forward buttons)
- Browser restart
- Tab close/reopen

✅ **Cart items are stored in:**
- `localStorage` under key `cart-storage`
- Properly formatted JSON
- Includes: `cartId`, `items`, `total`, `currency`

✅ **Console shows:**
- Clear debug logs with 🛒 emoji
- State updates in real-time
- Backend sync status

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If items still disappear after refresh:

1. **Check browser console** for errors or debug logs
2. **Clear localStorage** and try again:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```
3. **Verify localStorage is enabled** in browser settings
4. **Check if in incognito/private mode** (localStorage may be disabled)
5. **Look for CORS errors** (if frontend/backend are on different ports)

### If backend sync fails:

The cart will still work locally even if backend sync fails. Items will be stored with a `local-cart-*` cartId prefix, which is fine for development. The checkout flow has fallback logic to handle this.
