# Deploy Help & Support Pages - Quick Guide

## What Was Fixed
The production website was returning **500 Internal Server Error** when users clicked on:
- **Help Center** link in footer (`/en/help`, `/ar/help`)
- **Technical Support** link in footer (`/en/support`, `/ar/support`)

**Root Cause**: Pages didn't exist in the codebase but were referenced in the footer.

## Changes Made
✅ Created `/help` page with search and 6 help topic cards  
✅ Created `/support` page with support request form  
✅ Added missing FontAwesome icons to Icon component  
✅ All pages are fully bilingual (Arabic/English)  
✅ TypeScript compilation verified - no errors  

## Files Changed
```
frontend/app/[locale]/help/page.tsx       (NEW)
frontend/app/[locale]/support/page.tsx    (NEW)
frontend/components/ui/icon.tsx           (MODIFIED - added 4 icons)
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add missing Help and Support pages to fix 500 errors"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Verify Deployment
After the CI/CD pipeline completes, test these URLs:

**Production URLs to Test:**
- ✅ https://ersa-training.com/en/help
- ✅ https://ersa-training.com/ar/help  
- ✅ https://ersa-training.com/en/support
- ✅ https://ersa-training.com/ar/support

### 3. Functional Testing Checklist
Once deployed, verify:

- [ ] All 6 help topic cards display properly
- [ ] Card links navigate to correct pages (FAQ, Contact, Courses, Profile)
- [ ] "Contact Us" and "View FAQs" buttons work
- [ ] Arabic version displays correctly with RTL layout
- [ ] Animations and hover effects work
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works

#### Support Page (`/support`)
- [ ] Page loads without 500 error

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, rollback:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

The footer links will show 500 errors again, but the rest of the site remains functional.

## Additional Notes

### API Endpoints Used
Both pages use the existing Contact API:
- `POST /api/contact` - Handles both contact and support form submissions

### Design System
Pages follow the existing design system:
- **Primary Color**: #292561 (Purple)
- **Accent Color**: #00AC96 (Teal)
- **Font**: Cairo (Google Fonts)
- **Animations**: Fade-in, slide-in, scale-in with stagger effects

### SEO Considerations
Both pages are server-side rendered with Next.js App Router, ensuring:
- Fast initial page load
- Proper SEO indexing
- Dynamic meta tags based on locale

## Success Criteria
✅ No 500 errors on `/help` and `/support` pages  
✅ All footer links work correctly  
✅ Forms submit successfully  
✅ Both Arabic and English versions work  
✅ Mobile responsive design functions properly  
✅ No console errors in browser DevTools  

## Contact
If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check server logs for API errors
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Clear browser cache and test again
