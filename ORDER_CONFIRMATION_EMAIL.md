```

### 2. `backend/src/Services/EmailService.cs`
**Added (line 785-1149):**

### 3. `backend/src/Services/ClickPayGateway.cs`
**Constructor Updated:**

    IConfiguration configuration,
    HttpClient httpClient,
    ILogger<ClickPayGateway> logger,
    ErsaTrainingDbContext context,
    IEmailService emailService) // Added
```

**Webhook Updated (lines 201-229):**
```csharp
if (payment.Status == PaymentStatus.Completed)
{
    order.Status = OrderStatus.Paid;
    order.UpdatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;
    
    // Save changes first
    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    
    // Send order confirmation email
    try
    {
        var emailSent = await _emailService.SendOrderConfirmationEmailAsync(order, order.User.Locale);
        if (emailSent)
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("Order confirmation email sent successfully");
        }
    }
    catch (Exception emailEx)
    {
        _logger.LogError(emailEx, "Error sending order confirmation email");
        // Don't fail the webhook if email fails
    }
}
```

### 4. `backend/src/Services/HyperPayGateway.cs`
**Same updates as ClickPayGateway:**

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram
```
1. User completes payment → Payment Gateway
2. Payment Gateway → Webhook to our backend
3. Webhook validates payment
4. If payment successful:
   a. Update order status to "Paid"
   b. Save to database
   c. Fetch user's locale from order.User.Locale
   d. Call SendOrderConfirmationEmailAsync(order, locale)
   e. Generate localized email template
   f. Send via SendGrid
5. Log success/failure
6. Continue webhook processing (don't fail if email fails)
```

### Locale Detection
The system uses the user's `Locale` field stored in the database:
- User registers with language preference (ar/en)
- Locale stored in `User.Locale` field
- When order is created, user's locale is associated
- Email uses this locale for content generation

## Email Content Sections

### 1. Header
- Gradient background (teal to purple)
- Success message
- Thank you note

### 2. Success Icon
- Large checkmark in circle
- Teal background

### 3. Personal Greeting
- "Dear [User's Full Name]"
- Localized based on language

### 4. Invoice Box
- Bordered with teal color
- Invoice number prominently displayed
- Order details grid:
  - Order ID
  - Payment Method
  - Payment Date
  - Status (Paid - in green)

### 5. Order Items Table
- Three columns: Course | Qty | Price
- Professional table styling
- Total row with highlighted amount

### 6. Next Steps
- Blue info box
- Bulleted list of actions
- Clear guidance for users

### 7. Call-to-Action Button
- "View My Courses" / "عرض دوراتي"
- Links to user's enrollments page
- Gradient button style

### 8. Tip Box
- Yellow warning-style box
- Helpful reminder about email

### 9. Footer
- Company information
- Support email
- Website link

## Configuration Requirements

### appsettings.json
```json
{
  "SendGrid": {
    "ApiKey": "your-sendgrid-api-key",
    "FromEmail": "noreply@ersa-training.com",
    "FromName": "Ersa Training"
  },
  "App": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://api.ersa-training.com",
    "FrontendUrl": "https://ersa-training.com"
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Test
1. Complete a purchase through the platform
2. Check the registered user's email inbox
3. Verify:
   - Email received
   - Correct language
   - Order details accurate
   - All links working
   - Images and styling rendered correctly

### Test with Different Locales
1. Register user with Arabic locale
   - Complete purchase
   - Check email is in Arabic with RTL layout

2. Register user with English locale
   - Complete purchase
   - Check email is in English with LTR layout

### Check Logs
Look for these log messages in backend:
```
📧 Sending order confirmation email for order {OrderId}, locale: {Locale}
✅ Order confirmation email sent successfully for order {OrderId}
```

Or warnings:
```
⚠️  Failed to send order confirmation email for order {OrderId}
❌ Error sending order confirmation email for order {OrderId}
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:

1. **Email Service Isolation**
   - Email sending is wrapped in try-catch
   - Failures don't affect webhook processing
   - Order status still updated even if email fails

2. **Order Loading**
   - Checks if order data is already loaded
   - Reloads from database if needed with all relations

3. **Null Checks**
   - Validates order exists
   - Handles missing payment data gracefully

4. **Logging**
   - Informational logs for success
   - Warning logs for failures
   - Error logs with full exception details

## Advantages

✅ **User Experience**
- Professional communication
- Immediate confirmation
- Clear next steps

✅ **Record Keeping**
- Email serves as receipt
- Invoice details included
- Can be saved/printed by user

✅ **Multilingual Support**
- Respects user's language preference
- Proper RTL/LTR handling
- All content localized

✅ **Branding**
- Consistent with platform design
- Professional appearance
- Trust building

✅ **Support Reduction**
- Users have order details
- Clear contact information
- Self-service links included

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **PDF Invoice Attachment**
   - Generate PDF from invoice data
   - Attach to email

2. **Order Tracking Link**
   - Direct link to order details page

3. **Social Media Links**
   - Add company social media in footer

4. **Promotional Content**
   - Suggest related courses
   - Discount codes for next purchase

5. **Email Preferences**
   - Allow users to opt-out of certain emails
   - Email notification settings

6. **Email Analytics**
   - Track open rates
   - Monitor click-through rates
   - A/B testing different templates

## Notes

- **SendGrid Required**: The system uses SendGrid for email delivery. Ensure API key is configured.
- **Locale Field**: User must have a valid locale ('ar' or 'en') in the database.
- **Frontend URL**: Make sure `App:FrontendUrl` is correctly configured for button links.
- **Async Operation**: Email sending is asynchronous and won't block the webhook response.
- **No Retry Logic**: Currently, failed emails are logged but not retried. Consider adding retry logic in production.

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received
1. Check SendGrid dashboard for delivery status
2. Verify SendGrid API key is correct
3. Check spam folder
4. Verify "From" email is verified in SendGrid
5. Check backend logs for errors

### Wrong Language
1. Verify user's `Locale` field in database
2. Check if locale is being passed correctly to email service
3. Review logs for locale value

### Broken Links
1. Verify `App:FrontendUrl` configuration
2. Ensure URL doesn't have trailing slash issues
3. Test links in different email clients

### Styling Issues
1. Some email clients don't support all CSS
2. Inline styles are used for better compatibility
3. Test in multiple email clients (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

## Summary

This implementation provides a complete order confirmation email system that:
- Automatically sends after successful payment
- Includes all order and invoice details
- Supports both Arabic and English
- Uses professional HTML design
- Integrates seamlessly with existing webhook flow
- Handles errors gracefully
- Provides excellent user experience

The system is production-ready and requires only SendGrid configuration to function.
