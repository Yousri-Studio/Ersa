# Database Cleanup and Reseed - Quick Start Guide

This guide provides quick instructions for cleaning your database and reseeding it with course data from the Excel file.

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Created

1. **Excel Course Reader** - Reads `Products Details.xlsx` and converts to JSON
2. **Course Seed Data** - C# class with 14 courses from Excel
3. **SQL Cleanup Script** - Deletes orders, courses, and old domain users
4. **PowerShell Automation** - One-click cleanup and reseed
5. **Updated SeedData.cs** - Now uses Excel course data

## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended for Development)

```powershell
# Navigate to scripts directory
cd backend/scripts

# Run the automated script
./CleanupAndReseed.ps1
```

The script will:
- ‚úì Check for Excel file
- ‚úì Read and convert Excel data
- ‚úì Guide you through database cleanup
- ‚úì Show summary of 14 courses to be seeded

### Option 2: Manual (Recommended for Production)

#### Step 1: Backup Database
```sql
-- Always backup first!
BACKUP DATABASE [YourDatabase] TO DISK = 'backup.bak'
```

#### Step 2: Run Cleanup Script
```sql
-- Run: backend/scripts/CleanupDatabase.sql
-- This will delete:
-- - All orders and payments
-- - All courses
-- - Users with ersatraining.com domain
```

#### Step 3: Restart Application
```bash
# The application will automatically reseed courses from Excel
dotnet run
```

### Option 3: SQLite Quick Reset

```powershell
# Stop your application

# Delete the database
Remove-Item backend/src/ErsaTrainingDB.db

# Restart application - it will recreate with new data
dotnet run
```

## üìä What Will Be Seeded

14 courses from `Products Details.xlsx`:

| # | Course Name | Price (SAR) | Category |
|---|------------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Competency-Based Interviews | 1,200 | Custom Programs |
| 2 | Project Management Prep | 1,300 | Custom Programs |
| 3 | CBP Leadership | 1,840 | Professional Certs |
| 4 | Train-the-Trainer (TOT) | 4,000 | Professional Certs |
| 5 | Creative Ideas to Plans | 900 | General Courses |

| 12 | Saudi Labor Law | 650 | Custom Programs |
| 13 | aPHRi Certification | 3,200 | Professional Certs |
| 14 | PHRi Certification | 4,300 | Professional Certs |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### What Gets DELETED:
- ‚ùå All orders, payments, bills, enrollments
- ‚ùå All courses (to be replaced with Excel data)
- ‚ùå Users with `ersatraining.com` domain (old domain)

### What Is PRESERVED:
- ‚úÖ Categories and subcategories
- ‚úÖ Instructors
- ‚úÖ Content pages
- ‚úÖ Users with `ersa-training.com` domain (new domain)
- ‚úÖ Roles and permissions

## üîç Verification

After reseeding, verify with these SQL queries:

```sql
-- Should return 14
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Courses;

-- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders;

-- Should return 0  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM AspNetUsers WHERE Email LIKE '%ersatraining.com%';

-- Should return your admin users
SELECT Email FROM AspNetUsers WHERE Email LIKE '%ersa-training.com%';

-- List all courses
SELECT Id, TitleEn, TitleAr, Price FROM Courses ORDER BY Price;
```

## üìÅ File Locations

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Excel File | `Products Details.xlsx` | Source data |
| Course Seed | `backend/src/Data/Seeds/ExcelCourseSeedData.cs` | Generated C# code |
| SQL Cleanup | `backend/scripts/CleanupDatabase.sql` | Database cleanup |
| PS Script | `backend/scripts/CleanupAndReseed.ps1` | Automation |
| Documentation | `backend/scripts/DatabaseCleanupAndReseed.md` | Full guide |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Excel file not found"
**Solution**: Ensure `Products Details.xlsx` is in the root directory (same level as `backend/` and `frontend/` folders)

### Problem: "Courses not showing after restart"
**Solution**: 
1. Check application logs in `backend/src/logs/`
2. Verify database connection in `appsettings.json`
3. Ensure EF migrations are up to date: `dotnet ef database update`

### Problem: "SQL script fails with FK errors"
**Solution**: The script disables FK constraints, but if it still fails, run sections individually

### Problem: "Old domain users still exist"
**Solution**: The script only deletes `ersatraining.com` users, not `ersa-training.com` users (those are kept)

## ‚ú® What's Different From Before

### Old Seed Data (12 Courses):
- Hardcoded test courses
- Generic descriptions
- Example prices
- Random dates

### New Seed Data (14 Courses):
- Real courses from Excel
- Actual descriptions in English & Arabic

- Scheduled dates from Excel

## üéØ Next Steps

After successful cleanup and reseed:

1. ‚úÖ Test the application
2. ‚úÖ Browse courses in frontend
3. ‚úÖ Check course details pages
4. ‚úÖ Verify prices and descriptions
5. ‚úÖ Test course enrollment
6. ‚úÖ Check admin dashboard

## üí° Tips

- **Always backup before cleanup!**
- Run in development environment first
- Test thoroughly before production deployment
- Keep Excel file updated with latest course data
- Document any custom changes
