# Forgot Password Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete forgot password flow for the Ersa Training platform, allowing users to reset their passwords via email verification code.

## Features Implemented

### Backend (ASP.NET Core)

#### 1. API Endpoints
- **POST `/api/auth/forgot-password`** - Request password reset
  - Generates 6-digit reset code
  - Stores code using ASP.NET Identity's token storage
  - Sends reset code via email (SendGrid)
  - Returns generic success message for security (doesn't reveal if email exists)
  
- **POST `/api/auth/reset-password`** - Reset password with code
  - Validates reset code
  - Resets password using ASP.NET Identity
  - Cleans up reset code after successful reset

#### 2. Email Template
- Beautiful bilingual (Arabic/English) HTML email template
- Includes:
  - 6-digit reset code prominently displayed
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Security notice for unauthorized requests
  - Password strength tips
  - Support contact information
- Matches existing email design system (gradient colors, responsive layout)

#### 3. DTOs Added
```csharp
public class ForgotPasswordRequest
{
    [Required]
    [EmailAddress]
    public string Email { get; set; }
}

public class ResetPasswordRequest
{
    [Required]
    [EmailAddress]
    public string Email { get; set; }
    
    [Required]
    public string Code { get; set; }
    
    [Required]
    [MinLength(6)]
    public string NewPassword { get; set; }
}
```

### Frontend (Next.js 14 + TypeScript)

#### 1. Forgot Password Page (`/[locale]/auth/forgot-password`)
- Clean, modern UI matching existing auth pages
- Features:
  - Email input with validation
  - Loading state with spinner
  - Error handling with toast notifications
  - Link back to login page
  - Responsive design with image on desktop
  - Smooth animations

#### 2. Reset Password Page (`/[locale]/auth/reset-password`)
- Email parameter from URL (passed from forgot password page)
- Features:
  - 6-digit code input with validation
  - New password and confirm password fields
  - Password visibility toggle
  - Form validation (password match, minimum length)
  - Loading state with spinner
  - Error handling with toast notifications
  - Link back to login page
  - Responsive design with image on desktop

#### 3. Updated Auth Form
- "Forgot Password?" link now navigates to `/auth/forgot-password`
- Changed from `<a>` to Next.js `<Link>` for proper routing

#### 4. API Integration
Added TypeScript interfaces and API methods in `lib/api.ts`:
```typescript
export interface ForgotPasswordRequest {
  email: string;
}

export interface ResetPasswordRequest {
  email: string;
  code: string;
  newPassword: string;
}

// API methods
authApi.forgotPassword(data)
authApi.resetPassword(data)
```

### Localization

#### English (`locales/en.json`)
```json
"forgot-password": {
  "title": "Forgot Password",
  "subtitle": "Enter your email address to receive a password reset code",
  "email": "Email Address",
  "submit": "Send Reset Code",
  "submitting": "Sending...",
  "back-to-login": "Back to Login",
  "success": "Reset code sent to your email!",
  "error": "Failed to send reset code"
},
"reset-password": {
  "title": "Reset Password",
  "subtitle": "Enter the code sent to your email and your new password",
  "email": "Email Address",
  "code": "Reset Code",
  "code-placeholder": "Enter 6-digit code",
  "new-password": "New Password",
  "confirm-password": "Confirm New Password",
  "submit": "Reset Password",
  "submitting": "Resetting...",
  "back-to-login": "Back to Login",
  "success": "Password reset successfully! You can now login.",
  "error": "Failed to reset password",
  "code-required": "Reset code is required",
  "code-invalid": "Invalid reset code"
}
```

#### Arabic (`locales/ar.json`)
Complete Arabic translations for all UI text.

## User Flow

1. **Initiate Reset:**
   - User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login page
   - Redirected to `/auth/forgot-password`
   - Enters email address
   - Receives 6-digit code via email

2. **Receive Email:**
   - Beautiful branded email with reset code
   - Clear instructions in user's preferred language
   - Security notice about unauthorized requests

3. **Reset Password:**
   - Automatically redirected to `/auth/reset-password?email=...`
   - Enters 6-digit code from email
   - Enters new password (twice for confirmation)
   - Password must be at least 6 characters
   - Confirms reset

4. **Login:**
   - Redirected to login page
   - Can now login with new password

## Security Features

1. **Generic Messages:** Forgot password endpoint returns same message whether email exists or not
2. **Email Verification Required:** Only verified users can reset passwords
3. **Code Expiration:** Reset codes are temporary (managed by ASP.NET Identity)
4. **Secure Storage:** Codes stored using ASP.NET Identity's built-in token storage
5. **One-Time Use:** Reset code is removed after successful password reset
6. **Password Requirements:** Enforces minimum 6-character password length

- [ ] Test reset password with/without email parameter
- [ ] Test password match validation
- [ ] Test password visibility toggle
- [ ] Test loading states
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test success flows

### Email
- [ ] Verify email delivery via SendGrid

- [ ] Test email in English
- [ ] Check email formatting in different clients
- [ ] Verify reset code is included correctly

### Integration
- [ ] Complete full flow: forgot → email → reset → login

## Notes

- Reset codes are 6-digit numbers (100000-999999)
- Codes are stored using ASP.NET Identity's token storage system
- Email templates match the existing verification email design
- All UI text is fully localized in English and Arabic
- The feature follows the existing authentication flow patterns
- Security best practices are implemented throughout

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete flow in development environment
2. Verify email delivery works with SendGrid
3. Test all edge cases and error scenarios
4. Review security implications
5. Test localization for both languages
6. Deploy to production after thorough testing
