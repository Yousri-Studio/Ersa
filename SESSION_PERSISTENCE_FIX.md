# 🐛 Session Persistence Issue - Root Cause

## The Problem

User logs in → Page refreshes → Redirected back to login (session lost)

## 🔍 Root Causes Found

### Issue 1: Early Return in initFromCookie()

**File**: `frontend/lib/auth-store.ts` line 64

```typescript
if (!token || token.trim() === '' || get().isAuthenticated) {
  return;  // ❌ Returns early if already authenticated!
}
```

**Problem**: 
- User logs in → State saved to localStorage by Zustand persist
- Page refreshes → Zustand rehydrates state (isAuthenticated: true)
- `initFromCookie()` called → Sees isAuthenticated is true → Returns early
- But the user data might not have been rehydrated yet!

### Issue 2: Race Condition

**File**: `frontend/app/[locale]/admin/layout.tsx` lines 56-64

```typescript
await initFromCookie();  // Might return early

const currentState = useAuthStore.getState();  // Gets state immediately
if (!currentState.isAuthenticated || !currentState.user) {
  router.push(`/${locale}/admin-login`);  // ❌ Redirect!
}
```

**Problem**: Timing issue between Zustand rehydration and the check

### Issue 3: clearCorruptedStorage() Might Clear Valid Data

**File**: `frontend/app/[locale]/admin/layout.tsx` line 51-52

```typescript
const { clearCorruptedStorage } = await import('@/lib/custom-storage');
clearCorruptedStorage();  // ❌ Might clear the auth-storage!
```

**Problem**: This runs BEFORE checking authentication, might clear valid state

### Issue 4: Remember Me Not Implemented

The checkbox exists but doesn't do anything!

---

## 🔧 The Fix

We need to:
1. Fix the initFromCookie() logic to handle rehydration properly
2. Wait for rehydration to complete before checking authentication
3. Don't clear storage before authentication check
4. Implement Remember Me properly
