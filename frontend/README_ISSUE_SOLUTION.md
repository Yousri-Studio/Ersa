# 🎯 ISSUE DIAGNOSIS & SOLUTION

## What's Happening? 

The error you're seeing is from your **SmarterASP.NET server**, NOT your local computer.

### Error Location:
```
h:\root\home\ersatc-001\www\ersatraining\next.config.js  ← ON THE SERVER
```

### Your Files Status:
- 🏠 **Local Computer**: ✅ CORRECT (already fixed)
- 🌐 **SmarterASP.NET Server**: ❌ CORRUPTED (needs replacement)

## The Simple Truth

You've fixed the file on your computer, but you **haven't uploaded it to the server yet**. 

The server is still using the old corrupted file, which is why you still see the error.

---

## 🚀 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

**You need to UPLOAD the corrected file to your server.**

That's it. Just replace the file on the server.
