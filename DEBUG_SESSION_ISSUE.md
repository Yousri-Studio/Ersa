# 🔍 Debug Session Issue - Action Plan

## Steps to Diagnose

### 1. Check Browser Console After Login

Open DevTools Console and look for:
```
Login successful, redirecting...
```

Then after redirect, look for:
```
🔍 Checking admin access...
Already authenticated from storage, skipping validation
✅ Admin access granted
```

### 2. Check Cookies

After login, check:
- DevTools → Application → Cookies → https://ersa-training.com
- Look for `auth-token` cookie
- Check its value, expiration, domain, path

### 3. Check LocalStorage

After login, check:
- DevTools → Application → Local Storage → https://ersa-training.com
- Look for `auth-storage` key
- Check its value

### 4. Run This in Browser Console After Login

```javascript
// Check cookie
console.log('Cookie:', document.cookie);

// Check localStorage
console.log('LocalStorage auth-storage:', localStorage.getItem('auth-storage'));

// Check Zustand state
console.log('Zustand state:', useAuthStore.getState());
```

### 5. Refresh and Check Console Again

After refresh, look for:
```
🔍 Checking admin access...
Already authenticated from storage, skipping validation
```

OR

```
🔍 Checking admin access...
Found token in cookie, validating...
```
