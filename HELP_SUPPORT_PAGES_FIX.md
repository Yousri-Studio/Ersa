# Help & Support Pages - 500 Error Fix

## Issue
The production site was returning 500 errors when users clicked on the "Help Center" or "Technical Support" links in the footer. The error occurred at:
- https://ersa-training.com/en/help
- https://ersa-training.com/ar/help
- https://ersa-training.com/en/support
- https://ersa-training.com/ar/support

## Root Cause
The footer component (`frontend/components/layout/footer.tsx`) included links to `/help` and `/support` pages, but these pages did not exist in the codebase. When Next.js tried to render these non-existent routes using React Server Components, it resulted in a 500 Internal Server Error.

## Solution
Created two new pages with proper bilingual support (Arabic/English):

### 1. Help Center Page (`frontend/app/[locale]/help/page.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - Search functionality for help topics
  - 6 help topic cards with icons:
    - Getting Started (links to FAQ)
    - Payment & Billing (links to FAQ)
    - Courses & Certificates (links to courses)
    - My Account (links to profile)
    - FAQs (links to FAQ)
    - Contact Us (links to contact)
  - Call-to-action section for additional support
  - Responsive design with animations
  - Fully bilingual (AR/EN)

### 2. Technical Support Page (`frontend/app/[locale]/support/page.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - Support request form with fields:
    - Priority selection (Low/Medium/High)
    - Subject/Issue title
    - First and Last Name
    - Email address
    - Detailed issue description
  - Support features showcase:
    - 24/7 Support availability
    - Quick response (within 24 hours)
    - Professional team
  - Sidebar with:
    - Quick links to Help, FAQ, Contact
    - Contact information card
  - Form validation with error messages
  - Integration with existing contact API
  - Fully bilingual (AR/EN)

## Files Created/Modified
1. `frontend/app/[locale]/help/page.tsx` - Help Center page (NEW)
2. `frontend/app/[locale]/support/page.tsx` - Technical Support page (NEW)
3. `frontend/components/ui/icon.tsx` - Added missing icons (MODIFIED)

### Icons Added
- `book-open` (faBookOpen) - For help topics
- `user-circle` (faUserCircle) - For user account topics  
- `user-group` (faUserGroup) - For team/support features
- `chat-bubble-left-right` (faComments) - For communication features

## Technical Details
- Both pages use the same design system as existing pages (FAQ, Contact)
- Consistent styling with Cairo font and brand colors (#292561, #00AC96)
- Page load animations using `usePageLoad` hook
- Scroll animations with `ScrollAnimations` component
- Responsive grid layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Form validation using `react-hook-form`
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Integration with existing `contactApi` for support requests

## Testing
After deployment, verify:
1. ✅ Navigate to footer links "Help Center" and "Technical Support"
2. ✅ Pages load without 500 errors
3. ✅ All links work correctly (FAQ, Contact, Profile, Courses)
4. ✅ Search functionality filters topics
5. ✅ Support form submits successfully
6. ✅ Both Arabic and English versions display correctly
7. ✅ Responsive design works on all devices
8. ✅ Animations and hover effects work smoothly

## Impact
- **Fixed:** 500 errors on `/help` and `/support` routes
- **Improved:** User experience with comprehensive help and support pages
- **Enhanced:** Site navigation completeness
- **Added:** Professional support request system

## Related Links
The footer also references `/terms` which exists, and other routes that are properly implemented.
