## **Overview**

Implemented automatic email notifications to users when their password is reset or changed, enhancing account security and keeping users informed of account activities.

---

## **What Was Implemented**

### **Backend (C# / .NET)**

#### **1. Email Service Interface (`IEmailService.cs`)** - UPDATED
Added two new method signatures:
```csharp
Task<bool> SendPasswordResetConfirmationEmailAsync(User user);
Task<bool> SendPasswordChangedNotificationEmailAsync(User user);
```

#### **2. Email Service Implementation (`EmailService.cs`)** - UPDATED

1. **`SendPasswordResetConfirmationEmailAsync`**
   - Sends confirmation email after successful password reset via forgot password flow
   - Uses localized HTML email template
   - Includes reset details (date, time)
   - Provides security alert if user didn't initiate the reset
   - Includes next steps guidance

2. **`SendPasswordChangedNotificationEmailAsync`**
   - Sends notification email after user changes password from profile settings
   - Uses localized HTML email template
   - Includes change details (date, time)
   - Provides security tips for password management
   - Includes security alert if user didn't initiate the change

##### **New Email Templates:**

#### **3. Auth Controller (`AuthController.cs`)** - UPDATED

Updated the `ResetPassword` endpoint:
```csharp
[HttpPost("reset-password")]
public async Task<ActionResult<object>> ResetPassword([FromBody] ResetPasswordRequest request)
{
    // ... existing password reset logic ...
    
    // Send password reset confirmation email
    try
    {
        await _emailService.SendPasswordResetConfirmationEmailAsync(user);
    }
    catch (Exception emailEx)
    {
        _logger.LogError(emailEx, "Failed to send password reset confirmation email to user {UserId}", user.Id);
        // Don't fail the password reset if email fails
    }
    
    return Ok(new { message = "Password has been reset successfully. You can now log in with your new password." });
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatically sends confirmation email after successful password reset
- Graceful error handling (email failure doesn't fail the password reset)
- Proper logging for troubleshooting

#### **4. UserProfile Controller (`UserProfileController.cs`)** - UPDATED

**Dependency Injection Update:**
- Added `IEmailService` injection to the controller constructor

Updated the `ChangePassword` endpoint:
```csharp
[HttpPost("change-password")]
public async Task<ActionResult> ChangePassword([FromBody] ChangePasswordRequest request)
{
    // ... existing password change logic ...
    
    // Send password changed notification email
    try
    {
        await _emailService.SendPasswordChangedNotificationEmailAsync(user);
    }
    catch (Exception emailEx)
    {
        _logger.LogError(emailEx, "Failed to send password changed notification email to user {UserId}", user.Id);
        // Don't fail the password change if email fails
    }
    
    return Ok(new { message = "Password changed successfully" });
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatically sends notification email after successful password change

## **Email Flow**

### **Scenario 1: Forgot Password (Reset)**
1. User requests password reset via forgot password page
2. User receives reset code email
3. User submits reset code and new password
4. **NEW:** System sends password reset confirmation email
5. User can now log in with new password

### **Scenario 2: Password Change (Profile Settings)**
1. User logs into their account
2. User navigates to profile/settings
3. User changes password (requires current password)
4. **NEW:** System sends password changed notification email
5. User continues using account with new password

---

## **Security Benefits**

1. **Immediate Notification**
   - Users are immediately notified of any password changes
   - Helps detect unauthorized access attempts

2. **Action Verification**
   - Users can verify if they initiated the password change
   - Clear instructions if action was not initiated by them

3. **Security Tips**
   - Educates users on password best practices
   - Encourages stronger security posture

4. **Audit Trail**
   - Provides timestamp of password changes
   - Helps users track their account security events

---

## **Technical Details**

### **Error Handling**
- Both email sending operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Email failures are logged but don't prevent the password operation from succeeding
- Users get their password changed/reset regardless of email status

### **Logging**
- All email operations are logged with appropriate log levels
- Success: LogInformation
- Failure: LogError
- Includes user ID for troubleshooting

### **Email Service Provider**
- Uses SendGrid for email delivery
- Configured via `SendGrid:FromEmail` and `SendGrid:FromName` in appsettings
- Supports HTML email templates

### **Localization**
- Uses user's `Locale` property (from User entity)
- Supports "en" (English) and "ar" (Arabic)
- Falls back to English if locale is not recognized

---

## **Configuration Requirements**

### **SendGrid Configuration** (Already exists)
```json
{
  "SendGrid": {
    "ApiKey": "YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY",
    "FromEmail": "noreply@ersa-training.com",
    "FromName": "Ersa Training"
  }
}
```

   - Restore correct configuration

4. **Localization Testing**
   - Test with English user account
   - Test with Arabic user account
   - Verify correct language and RTL/LTR layout
