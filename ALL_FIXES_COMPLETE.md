# Complete Fix Summary - All Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

## Issues Fixed in This Session

### 1. ‚úÖ Missing Icons in Enrollments Page
**Problem:** Console errors about missing `academic-cap`, `refresh`, and `receipt` icons

**Solution:**
- Changed `academic-cap` ‚Üí `graduation-cap` (correct icon name)
- Added `refresh` (‚Üí `faArrowsRotate`) and `receipt` (‚Üí `faReceipt`) icons to Icon component

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/components/ui/icon.tsx`
- `frontend/app/[locale]/profile/enrollments/page.tsx`

**Documentation:** `AUTH_REDIRECT_FIX.md`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Authentication Redirect Loop on Page Refresh
**Problem:** Enrollments page redirected to login every time the page was refreshed, even when user was logged in

**Solution:**
- Added proper auth initialization sequence before checking authentication
- Wait for `initFromCookie()` to complete before checking `isAuthenticated`
- Added `authChecked` state to prevent premature redirects

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/app/[locale]/profile/enrollments/page.tsx`

**Documentation:** `AUTH_REDIRECT_FIX.md`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Missing Enrollments for Paid Orders
**Problem:** Users who purchased courses didn't see them in their enrollments (enrollments weren't created)

**Solution:**
- Created admin diagnostic endpoint to find paid orders without enrollments
- Created admin fix endpoint to automatically create missing enrollments
- Created PowerShell script (`fix-enrollments.ps1`) for easy fixing

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/Controllers/AdminController.cs`
- `fix-enrollments.ps1` (new)

**Documentation:** `ENROLLMENT_DIAGNOSTICS_FIX.md`

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Course 404 Error from Enrollments Page
**Problem:** Clicking on courses from enrollments page gave 404 error

**Root Cause:**
- Enrollments API returned `courseId` (GUID) but not `courseSlug`
- Frontend was linking to `/courses/{courseId}` instead of `/courses/{slug}`
- Backend endpoint expects slug, not ID

**Solution:**
- Added `courseSlug` field to `EnrollmentDto` (backend)
- Updated enrollments controller to include course slug in response
- Updated frontend to use `enrollment.courseSlug` in links

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/DTOs/EnrollmentDTOs.cs`
- `backend/src/Controllers/EnrollmentsController.cs`
- `frontend/app/[locale]/profile/enrollments/page.tsx`

**Documentation:** `COURSE_404_FIX.md`

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Order Status TypeError in My Orders Page
**Problem:** My Orders page crashed with `status.toLowerCase is not a function`

**Root Cause:**
- Backend was returning `OrderStatus` as a number (enum value like 0, 1, 2)
- Frontend expected it as a string (like "New", "Paid", "Cancelled")
- Frontend tried to call `.toLowerCase()` on a number

**Solution:**
- Changed `OrderDto.Status` type from `OrderStatus` to `string` (backend)
- Convert enum to string using `.ToString()` when creating DTOs
- Updated `InvoiceDto` and invoice generation to use string status
- Updated frontend `Order` interface to include 'Cancelled'

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/DTOs/OrderDTOs.cs`
- `backend/src/Controllers/OrdersController.cs`
- `backend/src/DTOs/InvoiceDTOs.cs`
- `backend/src/Controllers/AdminController.cs`
- `frontend/lib/api.ts`

**Documentation:** `ORDER_STATUS_FIX.md`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Backend won't build
**Error:** `file is locked by another process`

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Stop backend completely (Ctrl+C)
# Wait 3-5 seconds
# Then rebuild
dotnet build
```

### Issue: Still getting 404 on course links
**Solution:**
1. Make sure backend was rebuilt and restarted
2. Check enrollment API returns `courseSlug` field
3. Clear browser cache

### Issue: Still redirecting to login
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Logout and login again
3. Check that `auth-token` cookie exists

### Issue: Still getting TypeError on orders
**Solution:**
1. Make sure backend was rebuilt (not just hot-reload)
2. Make sure backend was restarted
3. Check API response - status should be a string like "Paid"
